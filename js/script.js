/* For this task you will be provided with both the existing HTML
 * (`former-html.html` - manual pairing version) of the component and the
 * starter HTML for the task, along with the completed CSS. Your task is to
 * write a JS function that generates a footnote reference list from
 * citation/reference pairs in the main content of the starter HTML file,
 * enabling the list to remain accurate if the pairs are reordered.
 *
 * To successfully complete the task, you must:
 *
 * 1. Populate the `js/script.js` file with a function that generates a
 *    footnotes reference list from the citation/reference pairs in the main
 *    content of the `starter-html.html` file
 *
 * 2. Link each citation to its reference so that the `selected` class is
 *    added to the appropriate reference `li` when the citation is clicked
 *
 * 3. Ensure that the function serves as intended if the citation/reference
 *    pairs are reordered within the main content
